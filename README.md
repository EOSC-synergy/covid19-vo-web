# COVID 19

The COVID-19 VO is a collaboration to support researchers with running
computational models for modelling and anlysing the current SARS-CoV-2
outbreak.

Computation is steered via our [Galaxy Portal](https://covid19.eosc-synergy.eu/galaxy/)

# Infrastructure

The infrastructure is based on simple OpenStack Installations, that is
ideally connected to the EGI Federated cloud.

The VO is supported by the [a]EOSC-Synergy
project](https://eosc-synergy.eu). It is backed by infrastructure from
individual computing centres. 

We are looking for additional resource centres. If you want to join,
please contact us.

Computing Centres currently supporting the COVID 19 VO:

- LIP, Lisbon, Portugal
- IISAS, Bratislava, Slovakia
